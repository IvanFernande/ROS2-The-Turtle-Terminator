# ROS2 Turtlesim: The Turtle Terminator

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0b1368a2-2074-4fb1-a694-66b68de0117e)

This repository contains two ROS2 nodes that interact with the `turtlesim` simulator. One node is responsible for spawning turtles at random positions, and the other controls a turtle to chase and "capture" the spawned turtles.

## Description

- **Spawner Node**: Generates turtles at random positions in the `turtlesim` simulator and keeps track of the alive turtles. It publishes a list of alive turtles on the `alive_turtles` topic and provides a `turtle_taken` service to remove turtles from the simulator.

- **Controller Node**: Controls the main turtle (`turtle1`) to chase the turtles generated by the `SpawnerNode`. When the main turtle gets close enough to a spawned turtle, it requests the `turtle_taken` service to remove the captured turtle.

## Requirements

- ROS2 Humble (or another compatible distribution)
- Python 3
- ROS2 `turtlesim` package
- Create a custom interface package including custom messages and services that are loaded into the repository.

## Objectives
The objective of this project is the implementation of ROS2 concepts such as:
- Creation of nodes.
- Creation of custom interfaces, including messages and services.
- Use of already created interfaces such as those of ‘turtlesim’.

And other tools not included in this repository such as:
- Configuration of parameters in the nodes.
- Creation of a launch file to run all nodes.

Parameters allow customisation of node-internal variables during execution, including in the launch file, so as research from this repository, it is recommended to investigate these definitions.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository into your ROS2 workspace:

   ```bash
   cd ~/ros2_ws/src
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/turtle_chaser.git
