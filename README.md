# ROS2 Turtlesim: The Turtle Terminator

This repository contains two ROS2 nodes that interact with the `turtlesim` simulator. One node is responsible for spawning turtles at random positions, and the other controls a turtle to chase and "capture" the spawned turtles.

## Description

- **Spawner Node**: Generates turtles at random positions in the `turtlesim` simulator and keeps track of the alive turtles. It publishes a list of alive turtles on the `alive_turtles` topic and provides a `turtle_taken` service to remove turtles from the simulator.

- **Controller Node**: Controls the main turtle (`turtle1`) to chase the turtles generated by the `SpawnerNode`. When the main turtle gets close enough to a spawned turtle, it requests the `turtle_taken` service to remove the captured turtle.
