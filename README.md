# ROS2-The-Turtle-Terminator
Random turtles appear in different places in the environment, and the main turtle continuously calculates which turtle is closest. Once it has its next target, it moves towards it to eliminate it. However, if a new turtle appears in its path, it will redirect itself to reach the nearest turtle.
